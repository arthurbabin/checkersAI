## Notation of Forsyth-Edwards (FEN)
- The 8 lines of the board are separated by `/`
- We read the board from the left to the right and from the bottom to the top
- Lowercase letters for the uncrowned pieces and uppercase letters for the crownheads
- B or b for the black pieces
- W or w for the white pieces
- empty spaces are represented by their number (`4` represents an empty line and `2bb` represents 2 empty cells and then 2 black pieces)
